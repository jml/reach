# reach

A Rust re-implementation of [DRMacIver](https://www.drmaciver.com/)'s [each](https://github.com/DRMacIver/each),
which is "a shell command for running robust, parallel, `for` loops with good feedback mechanisms."

`reach` does not aim to be a drop-in replacement for `each`.
In particular, it does not preserve strict compatibility.
